## Contributing to the notes

The repository (and notes) are open source, so you can contribute with your notes or suggest changes.
The [lecture notes](https://notes.wicker.life) are essentially Markdown files contained in [this folder](/notes/computerscience/). All lecture notes include mathematical formulas which are taken with LaTex.

> You can ignore everything other than the ["computerscience"](/notes/computerscience/) folder inside of the ["notes"](/notes/) folder, as it is only code used to translate the markdownfiles into a NextJS website.

To contribute to the notes and/or assignment submissions:

1. Clone the repository on your local machine
