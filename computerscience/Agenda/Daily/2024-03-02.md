###### morning entry
13:39 Woke up super late today. #person/caroline replied to my message. Not exactly what I had hoped for, but kind of what I had been expecting. Now I just need to move on. Today I am having lunch with #person/raman . I think I will tell him about my grandma, since he is the only one of the close friend group whom i haven’t told yet. I might also have a coffee with #person/katrina. I smoked a bunch yesterday, told myself it was justified. I’m at UM Sports now, waiting for Raman. Here I met #person/bea. I feel quite emotionally drained to be able to talk to Raman, but oh well we will see. 

13:44 Well. I just received messages from #person/caroline saying she is willing to give it a try. I am emotionally dead inside, with my grandma and everything (Caroline doesn’t know my grandma is dead), but also feel hopeful and cheerful, even though I know I will get hurt. Fuck.

16:06 I am so excited for the date with #person/caroline
