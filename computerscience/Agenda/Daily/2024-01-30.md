# diary
###### morning entry
00:42 I am looking to be serious about my eating. I purchased a subscription to a calorie tracker. I hope it was worth it (I am poor this month)
###### day entries
14:11 I cut my hair. It doesn't look horrible. I was looking for a cap but couldn't find one that would fit me nicely. I read a bit. I'm quite excited to show everyone the new haircut, but also kind of want to hide.
###### evening entry
18:51 I met with #person/agnese today for a glass of wine. It was nice, I also saw #person/rosie again. But I invested a lot of time on that, and I have very little time to study, work and to clean up my house, and my energies are low as usual these evenings. I could fall asleep any second. I would want to go home and nap, but at 21:30 I'd like to be here at UM Sports so I can sign up for volleyball with #person/carmen. I met Carmen again today as well, properly this time. She seems quite cute. 

00:43 Today was unproductive. I went home to take a nap at some point. When I went back to UM Sports they were having a fire drill - missed the most exciting moment at UM Sports and I am quite upset about it, but it's funny. I signed up to play volleyball with #person/carmen and I am quite excited for that. I also was ready to do circuit training with #person/simona, but unfortunately I work at that time. I did not study at all today, nor did I work. But I did get a haircut, and I am quite proud of it. 
I also did my laundry and almost finished cleaning the dishes.
