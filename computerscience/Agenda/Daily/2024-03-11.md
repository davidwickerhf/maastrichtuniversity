# diary
###### morning entry
10:13 So I haven‚Äôt been updating my diary in a little bit. Much has happened. I went to my grandma‚Äôs funeral, it was very sad. When I came back from Italy instead of waiting and taking time for myself I directly started looking for people. I firstly asked #person/katrina for lunch at Stappato, but before I saw her I accidentally met #person/caroline , then we walked to #person/feriel  and then #person/zep also showed up. I opened up about the funeral with Katrina and Feriel. Afterwards I went to Caroline. 

With Caroline we read together for a little bit, then we played some horror games on Roblox. Then we watched the Rocco Siffredi series on Netflix, which was very horny inducing. I kissed her on the forehead, and she kissed me back on the cheek. Then the cuddling was quite hot for the rest of the night.

In the evening she mentioned something that she wanted to tell me, she laughed it off and said she won‚Äôt tell me until the the time is right.

During the night she held onto my dick ahah, very cute but very hot.

In the morning I kissed her on the forehead again, and she kissed me on the cheeks. We made out a number of times. Finally we biked to university in the morning.

11:12 I haven‚Äôt done anything as of yet. I will attempt being productive now and work on the OOM Project.
