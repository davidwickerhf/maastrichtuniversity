###### morning entry
14:53 I woke up at #person/caroline’s place today. I slept over at hers for the second night in a row after she suggested we try things out between us. Tonight she kissed me a few times (on my forehead, cheek, hand) and kept stroking my hair. I am getting hopeful once again. I really hope things work out.

I was supposed to host a campus visit for a perspective student, but they didn’t show up. So I went home, changed and went to UM Sports. I am now here with #person/feriel and #person/nick .  Tonight I have gymnastics tryout with #person/bea . I am quite scared and lazy. I have 6 hours before then.
