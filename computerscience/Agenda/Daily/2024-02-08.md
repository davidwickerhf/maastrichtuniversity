###### morning entry
This morning I skipped my lecture because it seemed to be a review session on Object Oriented Programming. I need to review the lecture slides to make sure I didn’t miss anything

###### day entries
15:03 I am currently at the law faculty working. I think I am kind of flirting with #person/carmen but I can’t be entirely sure. I have not studied for the tutorial yet and I really need to get to it. I think I will leave the faculty around 16:45 depending on when the bus back to UM Sports is.
