###### morning entry
00:17 Would have liked to run this morning. But it's too late now and I really need to study for the resit tomorrow morning. I will begin running on Saturday.

09:53 I woke up late...
###### day entries
18:07 I went to sleep at 14:00 and came back to study at UM Sports at 17. I believe I am going to fail tomorrow's exam, but I am not worrying much about it. 
Before Fariel's shifts began, we saw #person/rocco driving away from UM Sports with a massive red truck.
At UM Sports I met with #person/feriel, #person/raman , #person/michaela, #person/simona, #person/lorelai, #person/filippo 

21:59 I am now at UM Sports. I have been here for about 30 minutes, trying to study. My studying is going very slow. I relapsed on drinking coffeine (RedBull), but I am justifying that since tomorrow morning I have the exam.
###### evening entry
01:08 I did not study for tomorrow's exam. I am going to fail such exam and I will have to retake it next year. I can live with that. But I really need to get my act together on academics. Work is doing alright, My CV is looking great, I am planning on improving my personal health, but I also really need to be more focused on my studying, otherwise everything else is pointless.
