# diary
###### morning entry
09:20 I woke up in time, which feels very good, nonetheless I struggled to come into the Law Faculty early as I was uncomfortable with the sweater I had picked for today. I am now at the Law Faculty
###### day entries
11:04 Had some news about. my grandma, she might have had a stroke. 
Work is not going too well, too many points where I am getting stuck.

13:31Still at the Law Faculty. I kind of want to try and rebuild the entirety of case-law-explorer but with alternative services than AWS. I hate AWS.

17:15 Andato in biblioteca con #person/caroline . Odio sto posto.

17:57 Working on my testimonial. My head hurts and I am hungry as fuck.
###### evening entry
20:57 I am now

01:03 I am at #person/caroline ‚Äòs house. I am so in love. We are cuddling and snuggling and I just want to kiss her and hold her
