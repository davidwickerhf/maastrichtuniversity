# diary
###### morning entry
00:46 I really hope I remember to write some morning entries and to keep my diary updated.

11:09 I am working at the law faculty now. Met with #person/vishal and my supervisor #person/shashank and another collegue of whom I do not remember the name. We got coffee and talked about food mainly. I am working on my task on disruption. I am quite stressed for the amount of things I have to do, and the little finance I have for this upcoming month.

17:26 I bought trash bags, went to Centre Ceramique and met #person/giulia and said hi. Now at UM Sports to meet with #person/raman and #person/feriel will attempt to study.

23:45 I did not study at all today. I want to start running.
