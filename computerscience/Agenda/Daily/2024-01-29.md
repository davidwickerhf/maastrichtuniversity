###### evening entry
23:07 So I am financially fucked for February, which is very very upsetting as I had in mind to spend a whole bunch on improvements (e.g. trimmer, beard growth shit, colon). I really need to watch my expenses for food as well, the model I have been keeping is not sustainable for this month. I also am planning on shaving my head and buying at least 1 berret.

23:43 I paid back all my debts. I have more money than calculated, which is good, but also concerning (I am afraid I missed a debt somewhere in the calculations). There is still a lot left to do to clean my house. I am considering buying the beard growth kit on a loan.

00:35 I purchased a trimmer as well. I am also looking into meal prepping. I think before I start going to the gym regularly I need to have a consistent meal prep in place. I also purchased UM Sports Subscriptions and Beart Growth kit. I took both of them on a loan.
