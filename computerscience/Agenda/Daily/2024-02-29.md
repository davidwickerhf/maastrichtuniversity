###### morning entry
21:22 Skipped my lectures to talk to #person/caroline . We talked for more than 4 hours about us. We concluded we are not going to try and see how it goes. We kissed twice. It didn‚Äôt seem to mean anything. I need to move on.
It was so flirtatious. I am feeling empty inside.
###### day entries

###### evening entry
21:22 Fuck. 

21:50 I want to write to caroline to express how I am feeling
- I was usually able to ‚Äúmove on‚Äù without too much hassle, I think because deep down I knew I wasn‚Äôt really letting of the idea of you, but this time it feels so certain
- Part of me wants to wait around and persist hoping one day you will come around. I once was ready to do that any time. Nowdays, I dont know if I could handle it

01:35 I texted #person/caroline . It was not pretty, very superficial. She did not seem at all interested in hearing me out. I am going to stop reaching out to her. I worry I also lost a friend with this, and I believe she knows this too. I really hope #person/feriel keeps her word and keeps her included.
It‚Äôs super late and tomorrow I will try to wake up around 8 so I can catch up on DSA tutorials. I will listen to some music now know. I will have a hard time sleeping today.
