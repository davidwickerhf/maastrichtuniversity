## Course description
In this course, we build a mathematical framework that is based on logic and reason. The main objective of the course is to make students familiar with the language of mathematics. Students will learn how to make sound arguments and to detect where and why certain arguments go wrong. For this purpose, we will discuss the basic principles of logic and, closely related, the basic types of mathematical proofs. In doing so, we will encounter numbers such as integers, natural numbers and real numbers and we shall examine what makes these numbers special. After that, we will use basic logic to discuss, among other things, the following mathematical concepts: infinity, sets, relations, functions, permutations and combinations. Our fundamental tool in all of this is plain common sense. You really do not need your toolbox of mathematical formulas learned in previous studies and neither do you need a calculator. Pen and paper are the basic instruments needed. After completing each topic, exercises will be provided to be completed in class or at home, since mathematics is mainly learned by practising repeatedly.
