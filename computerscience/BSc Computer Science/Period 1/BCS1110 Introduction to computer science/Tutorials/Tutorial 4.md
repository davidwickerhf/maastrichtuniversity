#### Tutorial questions
==**Subjective questions**==
1. **Define the following terms:** 
	1. a) Automaton 
	2. b) Alphabet 
	3. c) String 
	4. d) Language 
2. **Given an alphabet Σ = {a, b}, list some valid strings over Σ.** 
3. **Explain why we need a simpler way of discussing computing machines.** 
4. **Describe the concept of an automaton and its role as a mathematical model of a com- puting device.** 
5. **What are the reasons for building models in computing? Explain the significance of finite automata as abstractions of computers**
6. **Define an alphabet and a string over an alphabet Σ. Provide examples.** 
7. **Given an alphabet Σ = {a, b, c}, list some valid strings in the language of palindromes over Σ.**

**==Objective questions==**
1. Define an NFA and explain how it differs from a DFA in terms of determinism. 
2. Define the formal structure of a DFA and NFA (hint: look at the 5 tuple structure I disucssed in the lecture).
