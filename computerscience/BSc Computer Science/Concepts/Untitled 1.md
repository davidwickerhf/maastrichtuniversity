As a founding member of Fridays For Future Italy and a passionate advocate for climate change mitigation, my journey has been characterized by a deep commitment to climate justice activism. With a background in computer science, I am now driven to leverage my technical skills, particularly in Machine Learning, to address the challenges posed by climate change. This aspiration leads me to apply for the Computer Vision course, aiming to harness its potential in improving extreme weather predictions.

Understanding that the battle against climate change benefits significantly from technological innovation, I see a critical need for specialized knowledge in advanced technologies. The application of Computer Vision in analyzing and interpreting complex environmental data can revolutionize our approach to predicting and mitigating the effects of extreme weather events. My goal is to contribute to the development of accurate, timely prediction models, enhancing our resilience to climate-related disasters.

This course represents a pivotal opportunity for me to bridge my passion for environmental activism with practical technological solutions. I am motivated by the challenge of integrating Deep Learning and Computer Vision into climate science, believing that these tools can unlock new possibilities for climate mitigation. By advancing my skills in these areas, I aim to make a meaningful contribution to our understanding and response to climate change.
