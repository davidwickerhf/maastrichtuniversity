- The [[ISP]] provides the IP Addresses → 4 byte *(4 * 8 bits = 32 bits)* address
	- IPv4 and IPv6 standards
- **Static IP** → IP Address does not change (e.g. for web services)
- **Dynamic IP** → IP addresses change frequently (e.g. phone, laptop and personal devices)
- **Private IP** → Valid only within a local network (unique within the network)
- **Public IP** → Accessible anywhere on the internet (assigned to **router**)

- **Format**: XX.XX.XX.XX
- **Hierarchy** → First byte corresponds to the larger network, then the following is more and more specific
- **IPv6** → Expanding to 6bytes instead of only 4 bytes (but lacking infrastructure)
