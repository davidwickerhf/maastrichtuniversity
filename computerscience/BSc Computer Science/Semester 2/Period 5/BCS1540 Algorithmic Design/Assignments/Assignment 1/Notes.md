#### Machine A
- All tasks run on only 1 machine
- Machine can perform 1 task at a time
- If task cannot be scheduled at its assigned starting time, it cannot run 
- We need to maximize the number of tasks that the single machine perform

A task [A, B] starts at time A (or doesn’t run) → sequence [a, b], [b, c] is allowable.

- Tasks are not ordered
