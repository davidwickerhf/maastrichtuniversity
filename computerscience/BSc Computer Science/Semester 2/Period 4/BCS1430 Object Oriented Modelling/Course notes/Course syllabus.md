### **Week 1: Introduction & OOP Recap**
- **Software Complexity**
	- Understand the paradox of simple rules leading to complex outcomes.
- **Software Development Life Cycle**
	- Familiarize yourself with the Waterfall model.
- **OOP Basics** (Recap from Spriha's Lecture)
	- **Objects and Classes**: Basics of object-oriented programming.
	- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details.
	- **Inheritance**: Deriving new classes from existing ones.
	- **Polymorphism**: Ability to process objects differently based on their class.
	- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data with methods that operate on the data.

### **Week 2: OO Design Principles**
- **Quality Attributes**: Functionality, Reliability, Usability, Efficiency, Maintainability.
- **Use Cases**: Writing and understanding use cases in textual format.
- **OO Analysis and Design**: Identifying objects, classes, relationships, and interactions.
- **Design Principles**: DRY, KISS, YAGNI, Separation of Concerns, Principle of Least Astonishment, Law of Demeter, GRASP, SOLID principles.

### **Week 3: Refactoring and UML**
- **Refactoring**: When and how to refactor, principles of refactoring.
- **Code Smells**: Types and how to address them, including Bloaters, OO Abusers, Change Preventers, Dispensables, Couplers.
- **UML**: Conversion of code or problems into appropriate UML diagrams, including Class Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams, Use Case Diagrams, etc.

### **Week 4 & 5: Design Patterns**
- **Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Singleton, Decorator, Adapter, Facade, Proxy, Observer, Strategy Patterns**:
	- Understand the purpose of each design pattern.
	- Recognize situations for their application.
	- Ability to implement simple code snippets or draw UML diagrams for these patterns.

### **Sample Paper Highlights**
- **Functional vs Non-Functional Requirements**: Examples of each for an e-commerce platform.
- **Class Extensions and Abstract Classes**: Understanding class hierarchies in Java.
- **OO Design Violations**: Identifying violations of OO design principles like SRP, OCP, DIP, ISP, LSP.
- **Code Smells in Practice**: Recognizing and addressing code smells in given scenarios.
- **UML Diagrams**: Drawing state diagrams for real-world scenarios.
- **Design Patterns Application**: Identifying problems with current approaches and suggesting design pattern solutions.

### **Study Tips**
- Focus on understanding the **principles** behind each concept rather than memorizing definitions.
- Practice **drawing UML diagrams** for various scenarios, as this seems to be a significant part of your exam.
- **Review examples** of code smells and refactoring techniques, as these are practical skills that your exam will test.
- Understand the **application of design patterns** by practicing with code snippets or examples from the lectures.
