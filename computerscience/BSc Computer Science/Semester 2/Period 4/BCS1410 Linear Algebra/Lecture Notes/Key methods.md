### Finding the Null Space of a Matrix
1. Set up the equation $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$.
2. Reduce $A$ to its Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) using row operations.
3. Identify free variables (columns in RREF without a pivot).
4. Express the solution $\mathbf{x}$ in terms of free variables to find the basis of the null space.

### Determining if a Vector is in the Null Space of a Matrix
1. Given matrix $A$ and vector $\mathbf{v}$, set up $A\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}$.
2. Solve the equation; if it yields the zero vector, then $\mathbf{v}$ is in the null space.

### Finding the Column Space of a Matrix
1. Write down matrix $A$.
2. Reduce $A$ to RREF using row operations.
3. Identify pivot columns in RREF.
4. Select corresponding columns from $A$; they form a basis for the column space.

### Determining if a Vector is in the Column Space of a Matrix
1. Form the augmented matrix $[A | \mathbf{b}]$ with matrix $A$ and vector $\mathbf{b}$.
2. Reduce to RREF.
3. If the system is consistent (no row of form $[0, 0, ..., 0 | 1]$), then $\mathbf{b}$ is in the column space.

### Finding the Row Space of a Matrix
1. Write down matrix $A$.
2. Reduce $A$ to RREF using row operations.
3. Non-zero rows in RREF form a basis for the row space.

### Finding the Rank of a Matrix
1. Reduce the matrix to RREF.
2. Count the number of pivot columns; this number is the rank of $A$.

### Finding the Dimension of a Vector Space
1. Identify a basis for the vector space.
2. Count the number of vectors in this basis; this count is the dimension of the vector space.

### Finding the Inner Product
1. For vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$, calculate the sum of the products of their corresponding components, $\sum_{i=1}^{n} u_i v_i$.

### Finding the Vector Length (Magnitude)
1. For vector $\mathbf{v}$, calculate the square root of the sum of the squares of its components, $\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i^2}$.

### Finding the Vector Distance
1. The distance between vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ is the magnitude of $\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}$, calculated as $\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (u_i - v_i)^2}$.

### Finding the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
1. Set up the equation $(A - \lambda I)\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$, where $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue and $\mathbf{x}$ is an eigenvector.
2. Solve the characteristic equation $\det(A - \lambda I) = 0$ for $\lambda$.
3. For each $\lambda$, solve $(A - \lambda I)\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$ to find the corresponding eigenvector $\mathbf{x}$.

Let's extend the explanation with an example for each concept. Consider the matrix $A$ and vectors $\mathbf{u}$, $\mathbf{v}$, and $\mathbf{w}$ as follows:

$$ A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{w} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 11 \end{pmatrix} $$

### Example for Finding the Null Space of a Matrix
1. We set up $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$.
2. After reducing $A$, the RREF is:
$$ \text{RREF}(A) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} $$
3. There are no free variables, implying the null space contains only the zero vector, $\mathbf{0}$.

### Example for Determining if a Vector is in the Null Space of a Matrix
- To check if $\mathbf{u}$ is in the null space, we solve $A\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{0}$. Given $A\mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \neq \mathbf{0}$, $\mathbf{u}$ is not in the null space.

### Example for Finding the Column Space of a Matrix
- The columns of $A$ are already linearly independent. Thus, the column space of $A$ is spanned by its columns: $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}$.

### Example for Determining if a Vector is in the Column Space of a Matrix
- To check if $\mathbf{w}$ is in the column space, we set up and solve $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{w}$. Since $\mathbf{w}$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the columns of $A$, $\mathbf{w} = 1\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} + 2\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}$, it is in the column space. and $\mathbf{v}$ is $\sqrt{(1-2)^2 + (0-1)^2} = \sqrt{2}$.

### Example for Finding the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
1. Solve $(A - \lambda I)\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$ for $A$.
2. The characteristic equation is $\det(A - \lambda I) = 0$, leading to $\lambda^2 - 5\lambda + 4 = 0$, with solutions $\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\lambda_2 = 4$.
3. For $\lambda_1 = 1$, solve $(A - I)\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$ to find an eigenvector, and similarly for $\lambda_2 = 4$.

This provides a step-by-step example for each concept, illustrating how to apply the theoretical aspects to practical situations.
