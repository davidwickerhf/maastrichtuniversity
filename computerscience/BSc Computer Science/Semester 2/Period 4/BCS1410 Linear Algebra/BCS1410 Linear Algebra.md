## Course description
This course introduces the fundamental concepts of linear algebra, and examines them from both an algebraic and a geometric point of view. First, we address what can be recognized without doubt as the most frequently occurring mathematical problem in practical applications: how to solve a system of linear equations. Then we discuss linear functions and mappings, which can be studied naturally from a geometric point of view. Vectors spaces are then introduced as a common framework that brings all themes together. Next, we shift from the geometric point of view to the dynamic perspective, where the focus is on the effects of iterations (i.e., the repeated application of a linear mapping). This involves a basic theory of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which have many applications in various branches of science as for instance in problems involving dynamics and stability, in control theory, and in optimization problems found in data science. Key concepts in the course are vectors, matrices, systems of linear equations, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, linear transformations, and orthogonality. The software package Matlab is introduced in the accompanying computer classes, where emphasis is put on the application of linear algebra to solve real world problems.
