::: (Home)work exercise 3

---- You can use these classes for lab exercise 3 ----

1. Finish the node.java file by completing all the methods.

2. Test your program by running TreeExample.java. The output should be:

  node 1
    node 11
        node 111
        node 112
	  node 1121
	  node 1122
    node 12
  node 2
    node 21
	node 211
	   node 2111
    node 22

3. In the lecture we've discussed siblings, parents and children. 
But, for this exercise you're going to consider cousins.

So write an algorithm that for each node in the tree it finds the cousins of that node. 
That means all nodes that are children of that node's parent. Make the algorithm print 
all the cousins in a relevant order.
