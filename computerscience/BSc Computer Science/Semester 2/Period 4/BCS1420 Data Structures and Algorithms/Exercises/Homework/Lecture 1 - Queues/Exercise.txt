A double-ended queue is a list that allows for insertions and removals at either its head or its tail. 

To store the values in the queue, use a linkedlist.

What is the worst case run-time of enqueueing or dequeueing elements from your queue? Is this the best run-time you think?
Is there an easy way to adapt your program to ensure that each operation in a double-ended queue runs in O(1) time?
