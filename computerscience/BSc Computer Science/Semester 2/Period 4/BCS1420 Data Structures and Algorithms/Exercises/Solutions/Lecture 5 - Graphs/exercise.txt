::: (Home)work exercise 5

--- You can use these classes for lab assignment 4 ---

Start by examining the Graph.java, Vertex.java and Edge.java files.
Try to comprehend how these classes can be used to construct a complete directed graph with weights between nodes

1. Finish the methods in the Graph.java file

2. Check your implementation by building you own graph (you will also do this in Lab assignment 4)

3. Does your graph contain any cycles? That means a path that you can follow in the graph that leads from and to a single node.
   - If no, build a graph that contains at least 1 cycle
   - Now that you have a graph that contains a cycle. Write an efficient algorithm that returns the pathlength of the longest cycle in the graph

4. A minimum spanning tree is a tree that contains all nodes in a graph without any cycles. To build a spanning tree from a graph, all paths that do not contain any cycles must be found.
   Find an efficient way of building a spanning tree from your graph, do some research in the slides or online to find a suitable algorithm to perform this task.
