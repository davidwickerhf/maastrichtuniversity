::: (Home)work exercise 1

Start by examining the IteratableList.java, Node.java and LinkedList.java files.

These files contain Skeleton code (the layout of the code without actual implementation) for an iterable list.
This means a List which can be iterated or "walked through" element by element. Internally the list maintains the 
current position of the last visited element.

Try to comprehend how these two classes and the interface can be used to construct a complete implementation 
of an iterable LinkedList.

1. Finish the methods in the LinkedList.java and Node.java file

2. Check your implementation by running the LinkedListExample class
