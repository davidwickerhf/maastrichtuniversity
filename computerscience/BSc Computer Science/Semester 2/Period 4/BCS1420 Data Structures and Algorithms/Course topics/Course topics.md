To prepare effectively for your exam, focusing on the following structured list of topics and concepts in dynamic programming, categorized by importance and in sequential order, will be crucial. This compilation is based on the comprehensive learning goals provided:

### Core Concepts in Dynamic Programming:
1. **Understanding Dynamic Programming**:
   - Principles of optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.
   - The methodological approach to dynamic programming: identifying subproblems, memoization vs. tabulation, constructing DP solutions.

2. **Problem Solving with Dynamic Programming**:
   - Solving the knapsack problem: Understanding problem statement, simple vs dynamic programming approach, constructing and filling the DP table.
   - Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) and Longest Common Substring: Problem statement, dynamic programming solution, implementation details.
   - Real-world applications of dynamic programming: Bioinformatics (DNA sequence analysis), version control systems (diff tools), text processing, and word wrap algorithms.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles Related to ADTs:
- Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism: their roles in creating Abstract Data Types (ADTs).
- Designing and implementing classes for ADTs using OOP principles.
- The distinction between ADTs and concrete implementations.

### Data Structures:
- **Lists**: Concepts of linear data structures, array vs linked lists, singly and doubly linked lists, their complexities.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Understanding, implementing, and the complexities of basic operations.
- **Sets**: Differences between sets and lists, basic set operations, and their complexities.
- **Trees**: Types of trees (binary, BSTs, balanced, general), basic operations, and their applications.

### Algorithm Analysis:
- Fundamental concepts including big-O notation, time complexity.
- Analyzing the efficiency of algorithms, understanding common complexity classes.
- Worst-case, average-case, and best-case scenarios.

### Hashing:
- Dictionary ADT, hashing and hash tables, collision resolution techniques.
- Performance analysis of hash tables, hash function trade-offs.

### Sorting Algorithms:
- Concepts including stability, in-place, and comparison-based sorting.
- Implementing and analyzing sorting algorithms, understanding their complexities.
- Sorting in linear time and with limited memory.

### Graphs:
- Graph data structure fundamentals, types of graphs, representations, and basic operations.
- Graph traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS), shortest path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's), and graph theory.

### Advanced Data Structures:
- **Tries**: Basic concepts, prefix tries, compression, implementation, and applications.
- **String Algorithms**: Pattern matching algorithms (brute-force, KMP, Boyer-Moore), their complexities, and use cases.

### Algorithmic Methods:
- **Greedy Algorithms vs Dynamic Programming**: Understanding both, identifying when to use each.
- **Divide-and-Conquer**: Concepts, breaking down problems, recursion in divide-and-conquer algorithms, merge step, and base case identification.

### Practical Application and Implementation:
- Implementing dynamic programming, greedy, divide-and-conquer, and sorting algorithms in real-world applications, and explaining their performance.

Focusing on these topics, structured around core principles, specific data structures, algorithm analysis, and practical applications, will provide a comprehensive foundation in dynamic programming and related concepts for your exam preparation.
