- Fast pointers → 
- Slow pointers → 

1. We begin with both pointers pointed at the same element
	1. Slow pointer moves 1n
	2. Fast pointer moves 2n
2. Once the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle
3. Modify the next part of the list and reverse the order

Use LinkedLists. Identify which node in the list points to which value
