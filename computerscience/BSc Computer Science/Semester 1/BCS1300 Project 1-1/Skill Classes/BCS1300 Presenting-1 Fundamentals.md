#### Effective communication as an optimization problem
- **Communication** → exchange of a message between a speaker and an audience
	- We want an audience to **pay attention**, **understand** and **act** upon our message
- Difference between raw information and a message
	- What? → Raw information
	- So what? → Message
- **Constraints** → Time, Space, Audience
	- Hard constraints
	- Flexible constraints
- **Goal of an optimization problem** → maximizing an objective by tweaking variables
	- In communication → maximizing what the audience takes out from the communication
- **Variables in communication**
	- Slides, time, delivery, and so on

#### The three laws of effective communication
- **Adapt to the audience** → audience imposes constraints, while speaker has freedom to adapt to the situation
- **Maximize signal-to-noice ration**
- **Use effective redaundancy** → but not overdo it

#### Structure, hierarchies and balance
- Hierarchy
	- No more then 3 levels, and no more then 5 items per level
