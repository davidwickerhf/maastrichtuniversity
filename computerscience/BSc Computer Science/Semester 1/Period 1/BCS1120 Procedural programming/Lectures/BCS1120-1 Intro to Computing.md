## Lecture notes
#### Van Neumann Architecture
- Described a computer with main components
	- Control unit → Implements the sequential order of instructions
	- [[Arithmetic Logic Unit]]
	- Memory
	- Input and Output → Need to compensate for speed differences
- Stored program concept → storing a program in memory
- Sequential execution of instructions
- Machine language 
- **Assembler** (Assembly) → intermediary between human programming language and machine learning

#### Memory
Each memory cell has unique address (4bits) and XXX
- RAM (Random Access Memory) → Volatile
- ROM (Read Only Memory) → They store very basic functionality needed to run OS or programs
- Mass Storage Devices → USB, SSD, Hard Drives, Sequential Access Disks (e.g. tape)

#### Execution cycle
1. Program in memory → instruction is fetched
2. Processor (CU and ALU) → Decodes and executes instruction
3. Processor requests for next instruction (Sequential)

#### Programming languages
- Compiled languages
- Interpreted languages

#### Compilation process
- [ ] get screenshot from slide

#### Java and JVM
- OOP Oriented
- Interpreted → Java Virtual Machine
- Multithread 
- General-Purpose

#### Summary
- Book Chapter 1
- Read Game Lap 1 Student Handbook for Friday
