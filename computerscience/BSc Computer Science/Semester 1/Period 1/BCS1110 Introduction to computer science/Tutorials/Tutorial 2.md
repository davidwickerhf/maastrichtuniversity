#### Tutorial questions
- **Applying Moore’s Law, how much larger would you expect a computer from 30 years ago to be by comparison to the computer you currently use?** 
	- Moore’s Law states that the number of transistors in a chip doubles every 2 years.
	- So a computer 30 years ago would theoretically be 30/2 (15) times larger than today
- **Using the Mayan numeral system, what are the decimal numbers 12, 123, 452, and 1256? Research online for your answer.** 
- **Each text message contains a date (8 bytes), time sent (4 bytes), up to 160 characters of text, and the sender’s phone number (8-byte number). How many text messages can you store on a 128GB hard drive?** [Hint: Read the required reading for this lecture]
