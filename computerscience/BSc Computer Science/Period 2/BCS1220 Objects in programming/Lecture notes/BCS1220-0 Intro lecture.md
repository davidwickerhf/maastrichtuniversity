#### Objects and classes

#### [[Encapsulation]] principle
> [!note] Separation of implementation and interface

- Methods can be used without knowledge of the inner workings
- Inner workings can be modified without impacting use


#### Constructors

- They do not have return types
- The name always matches the name of the class
